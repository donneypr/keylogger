# Keylogger using `pynput` in Python

This project is a basic keylogger built using the `pynput` library in Python. It logs every key pressed by the user and stores it in a file called `keyfile.txt`. The keylogger runs in the background, capturing key presses until it is manually stopped.

## Features
- Captures all keystrokes
- Saves key logs to `keyfile.txt`
- Uses the `pynput` library to listen for keyboard input
- Simple and easy to understand implementation

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- The `pynput` library (you can install it using the command below)

```bash
pip install pynput
```
